# Popular-Movies-Stage-2
This contains the complete Popular-Movies Stage 2 Code done under the Udacity Android Nano Degree Program.

Project Summary

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project,I've built an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

This app makes use of the most popular The Movie Db API to get the movies playing and also display the most popular movies based on the user ratings.
Also this makes use of the most popular libraries such as ButterKnife, Picasso, etc.

## Features

With the app, you can:

* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
* Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
* Watch trailers
* Read reviews
